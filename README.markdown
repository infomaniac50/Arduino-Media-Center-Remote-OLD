## Media Center Remote for Arduino

### Description
This project is a media center remote control. It uses an infrared LED emitter and is connected through the local network using the Arduino ethernet or Arduino + Ethernet Shield. It will eventually be able to control arbitrary devices through a web interface or smartphone. Which of those two will be used or even both is yet to be determined. This is currently an unfinished project so stuff may break, probably quite frequently.
